## Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, my name is Yigit and this is my portfolio page! I am trying to get into full stack developing career with the help of my coding bootcamp. I also listed the projects that I made in the past during my bootcamp, make sure you'll have a look and reach me out and tell me how you like it!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have created this website to make it look modern using many CSS features for showing my portfolio. When I look at other big companies' website, I've realized simplicity and being easy to read is really important. Also it solves my problem for publishing my portfolio in one specific website link that can include all of my projects I have created. From this website I've learned how to align images with everything else on the website, making it responsive and using visual CSS effects such as hovers and shadows to make it look better.
